<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project uses the **Oxford Flowers 102 dataset** provided by the [Visual Geometry Group of University of Oxford]((http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102).

The dataset consists of 102 different flowers commonly found in the United Kingdom. For each flower class approx. 40 to 258 images are provided.

### Built With

This project was built in Python 3.x and the following Jupyter Notebook IDE. The following libraries were used:

* Numpy, pandas
* Tensorflow (version 2.1.0)
* Tensorflow datasets(tfds)

Additonally, a GPU-enabled workplace was used, which significantly improved processing and training time.

### Usage

The project files include a `predict.py` file that uses a pre-trained network to predict the class for an input image. 

`predict.py` reads an image and a saved Keras model and then prints the most likely image class and it's associated probability.
